# Vocabulary Trainer

The program allows you to train the vocabulary (but you can use any "pairs" e.g. state - capital or province - city) using your own list in txt file. You can use "reverse" mode - click on "R". You will get translation - word pairs.

Load a txt file in this format (you will have to type a translation as an answer):
```
word - translation 
word - translation
[...]
```

You can use [Word List](https://github.com/Pdzoc/Word-list) to prepare your file.
